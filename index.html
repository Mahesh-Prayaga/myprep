    <h1>Welcome.</h1>
    <p>
      Greetings to everyone reading this. Allow me to introduce myself. My name
      is Mahesh Prayaga, and I'm a computer science student in my final year of
      diploma studies. Currently, I am preparing for the lateral entry entrance
      exam for engineering, ECET 2024. My diploma college is located in Andhra
      Pradesh, where I've been residing. However, my goal is to pursue my
      bachelor's in technology wherever I secure admission. Whether it's in
      Andhra Pradesh or Telangana, the only requirement is that it be a good
      college. Therefore, I will be taking the ECET exam in both states.

      The aim of this website is to document my preparation for the exam. I
      believe this serves two purposes: firstly, creating a record of my
      preparation journey, and secondly, functioning as a web development
      project. I aspire to make this website as aesthetically pleasing as
      possible, emphasizing a minimalistic design, which happens to be one of my
      favorite concepts.

      'MyPrep' operates in a format of days. There will be an option called
      'Days' in the navbar, allowing anyone to access information about any
      specific day and learn about my preparation.
