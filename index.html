          Greetings to everyone reading this. Allow me to introduce myself. My
          name is Mahesh Prayaga, and I'm a computer science student in my final
          year of diploma studies. Currently, I am preparing for the lateral
          entry entrance exam for engineering, ECET 2024. My diploma college is
          located in Andhra Pradesh, where I've been residing. However, my goal
          is to pursue my bachelor's in technology wherever I secure admission.
          Whether it's in Andhra Pradesh or Telangana, the only requirement is
          that it be a good college. Therefore, I will be taking the ECET exam
          in both states.
        </p>
        <p class="items">
          The aim of this website is to document my preparation for the exam. I
          believe this serves two purposes: firstly, creating a record of my
          preparation journey, and secondly, functioning as a web development
          project. I aspire to make this website as aesthetically pleasing as
          possible, emphasizing a minimalistic design, which happens to be one
          of my favorite concepts.
        </p>

          'MyPrep' operates in a format of days. There will be an option called
          'Days' in the navbar, allowing anyone to access information about any
          specific day and learn about my preparation.
        </p>
        <p class="items">Thank you, that's the plan!</p>
